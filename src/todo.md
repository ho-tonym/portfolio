- dont allow text wrapping h1 project
- where should the user look- make sure the delays are appropriate

- instead of having all effects in componentwillmount
- use some componentwillunmount

- uhh react is rerendering like crazy
- there is a weird spot when where image transition from home to each proj page is weird
some mobile pictures

delayed animations all around - consistent thematic

all works/selected works

drop shadow is too intense
- trim pokjedex pics
- fix colors

- exit anim
    - either 2 panel color anim
        - image gets big to cover the screen
        - vh of background- smooth

slow out - speed up in mid - slow in

d3-easings- remove? idk

stroke widths all the same
THROTTLE- scroll events, debounce everything

hide scrollbars
extra distance on scrollbar- fix

- position: fixed for right links about,work- its oddly moving..

- you can still hover botlinks when they are supposed to be hidden

dont allow scroll when in overlay
====
1. preloader
- almost setup
2. transition from home to each proj page
- almost setup
3. image anim when scroll flipping
4. overlay - when opened anim
- almost setup - just adjust
5. make each proj page cleaner?

vh enter when preloader leaves
